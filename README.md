# MoonE9
Internet Explorer 9/10 theme for Pale Moon. This theme is a Port of FoxE9 for the Pale Moon web browser.
Moon E9 is a theme for Pale Moon. If this breaks your Pale Moon profile I am not responsible. I did not make this theme, the theme is a Firefox 4 theme called FoxE9. Do not ask me to port other IE themes, (such as IE7/8) as I have tried but they are not compatible with Pale Moon. If you want an IE6 theme go here. https://wink.messengergeek.com/t/ie-theme-for-pale-moon/5724. 
Make sure you go to about:config and search for “browser.padlock.shown” once you see it set it to false. Go here: https://addons.palemoon.org/addon/title-bar-customizer/ . Once installed hit options, then custom. Now delete everything in the text box. Then right click on the toolbar and check “Tabs on Top” and there you go, you have an almost identical theme to IE9 on Pale moon!
